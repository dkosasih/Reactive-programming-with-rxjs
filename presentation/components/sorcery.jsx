                <br />
                ðŸ‘‰ There is no special ingridients with Observable
                <br />
                ðŸ‘‰ Observable is just a javascript functions
                <br />
                ðŸ‘‰ And RxJS just ensure those functions is perform as it intended to
                <br />
                ðŸ‘‰ Let's have a look at what Observable is like - 
                disclaimer: this is not implementation of Observable, it's just a conceptual.
                There are more capable people who work on RxJS that implements Observable properly
                <br />
